YHA was a good shout, quality sleep, decent WiFi and so far the best breakfast. Fairly easy cycling in terms of distance to Newport but it was very hilly. I'm getting better at hills now, I can definitely feel some power building when I need to lump up a 12% gradient and it's definitely more interesting than bumbling along the flats for 4 hours. Arrived here about 3 and the YHA at Newport is closed (and tiny in comparison) so I'm hoping it opens at 5. If it doesn't then I'm in for a very unfortunate last minute rework of accommodation. 

I think they'd had a lot of cancellations on account of the showers being cold - I was a bit worried about having a cold shower but it was perfectly tolerable.  I wouldn't call it a luxury shower but it wasn't mains water cold, just....not hot.  Bike storage here was pretty good - they had sheffield stands inside a locked shed and although the code wasn't very original I felt like they'd not really had any crime around Newport in a long time.

I spent a few hours at the beach waiting for the hostel to open at 5 and it was really nice.  I accidentally parked my bike on the main coastal walking route at a really narrow point but nobody seemed overly bothered.  

Sit bones feel alright, bit sore but I can cope with it. 

Tomorrow is basically going to rain in the morning but it looks like it's going off in the afternoon. If I get lucky it'll be going south so I can ride out of it. It'll dry off in the afternoon and I've got a Travelodge in Aberystwyth so it'll most likely be really warm and I'll have space to dry everything.  

Ate some banana chips today, not because I was particularly hungry, I just wanted to get rid of them!

YHA was really nice, had the room to myself and slept well (it was a bit chilly though, base layer came in handy). I'm first up, just having a tea. Spotted some ultrasun in the kitchen and I'm sorely tempted to steal a few pumps to get me through the rest of the trip. Gotta go find breakfast and check on the drying in a bit. 



The volunteer has just come down so I can't steal the ultrasun any more.
