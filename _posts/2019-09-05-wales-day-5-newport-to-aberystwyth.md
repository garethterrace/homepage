It's Day 5 now. We're going to hit half way!



Bit of rain forecast and it's damp outside but I'm not overly fussed. Looks like the sun will be out in the afternoon so I should arrive dry in Aber. 



Well it was fairly damp and really quite cold at times. The arm warmers came in very useful. Riding on that A road all day was hellish. The hills were relentless and there was nowhere to let traffic pass. I felt hugely pressured for all of the ride. I couldn't find lunch so ended up in a petrol station forecourt with a coffee and spar sandwich. They did have a toilet though so that was nice.



Got to Aber by about half 3 and was let straight into the room with the bike. Had an ace shower and cleaned most of my clothes. They're hopefully drying in the room now. I'll hairdry them a bit when I get back just to make sure.



In Byrgyr now having a crazy pork burger and salad, with a bedrock blonde. It was nice.



Walked up and down the Aber seafront and then came back to the room for a bath. Legs are really tired and I think I went a bit hard. Gonna take it easy tomorrow.
